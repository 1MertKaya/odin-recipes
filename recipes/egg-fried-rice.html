    <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong><br><br>
    <li>250g long grain rice</li>
    <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>2 spring onions, sliced, to serve</li>
    </ul> <br>

    <ol><strong>Instructions</strong><br><br>
    <li>Cook the rice following pack instructions, then drain, spread it out to steam-dry and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large wok over a high heat, then add the onion and fry until lightly browned, around 5 mins. Add the rice, stir and toast for about 3 mins, then move to the side of the pan.</li>
    <li>Add the remaining oil, then tip in the egg mixture. Leave to cook a little, then mix in with the rice 	&#8211; stir vigorously to coat the grains or, if you prefer the egg chunkier, allow to set for a little longer before breaking up and stirring through. Tip into a serving bowl and scatter over the spring onion to serve. You can also add sesame oil, ground white pepper and a splash of soy sauce to season.</li>
